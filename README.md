- Topography control (ON/OFF) to avoid to planting over rock clusters and mountains;
- UXO doesn't respect Ethics or topography controls;

- Set (or not) for each kill zone has a faction owner;
- Set for each kill zone a doctrine: Anti-personnel, Anti-materiel, Hybrid, UXO or Booby-trap;
- Easy explosive devices amount's management through the global intensity presets: low, mid, high, or extreme;
- Set (or not) for AM doctrine plants its mines only on roads and streets;
